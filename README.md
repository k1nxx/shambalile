## About

Iran has been struggling with an upcoming pandemic of agricultural resource shortage, including the cost of expensive important systems this project seeks to shine a light upon this cause and contribute to its success. This project strives to provide accessible and easily configurable nodes to farmers around the world unveiling useful and adaptible insights to their environment.

## Goals

### 📈 Monitoring

#### 🧪 Harmful chemicals

A significant trend of smoking has caused harm to many water sources leading to different crops used daily by the iranian population. Providing insights to these chemicals stand as one of the key motives of this project.

#### 💧 Wind, water, air

Monitoring wind, water, and air are amongst the most important contributors to this cause providing key details as where strategical locations for specifics plants may be. 

#### 🎥 Video

Video monitoring can also be a key insight for farmers, providing easy decision making.

#### ☀️ Sun light

The growth of plants heavily rely on adaquate sunlight. Monitoring exact sunlight levels and changes during hours of the day, by using both gathered data and trends aswell as weather trends can lead farmers to make the best decisions in a split second!

### 🧑‍🔬 Patterns and Predictions

#### 🌪 Fire, Floods, and Derecho 

Early detection systems can be cruical for farmers. 

## Phases

### Phase 1 (Light and Temperature)
#### Light

#### Temperature

#### Sensors

#### Detection with AI
