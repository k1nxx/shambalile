# About

Inadaquate infrastructure has been hampered by outdated methods as a result agriculture has declined in many countries such as Iran. **Shambalile** serves as a scalable and pragmatic monitoring solution offering critical insights to environmental factors. A modular node-based system integrates artificial intelligence providing data-driven solutions and adaquate feedbackt. 

# Goals

## 📈 Monitoring

### 🧪 Harmful chemicals

A significant trend of smoking has caused harm to many water sources leading to different crops used daily by the iranian population. Providing insights to these chemicals stand as one of the key motives of this project.

### 💧 Wind, water, air

Monitoring wind, water, and air are amongst the most important contributors to this cause providing key details as where strategical locations for specifics plants may be. 

## 🎥 Video

Video monitoring can also be a key insight for farmers, providing easy decision making.

### ☀️ Sun light

The growth of plants heavily rely on adaquate sunlight. Monitoring exact sunlight levels and changes during hours of the day, by using both gathered data and trends aswell as weather trends can lead farmers to make the best decisions in a split second!

## 🧑‍🔬 Patterns and Predictions

### 🌪 Fire, Floods, and Derecho 

Early detection systems can be cruical for farmers. 

## Phases

### (Phase 1 (Light))[https://github.com/k1nxx/shambalile/wiki/Phase-1-Analysis]

Light can be one of the most contributing factors in a plants growth, reliant on a multitude of parameters.
