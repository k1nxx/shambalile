# Configuration

The configuration process must be concise and easy to follow, users should spend minimal fully configuring their nodes. The process should follow as below:

1. **Welcome**

   Briefly describes the project, and goes into detail about how the configuration process will be.

2. **Setup process**

   As this process is quite complicated it will be divided in chunks:

   1. **Device configuration**
    User should mention how they want their nodes to be set-up. Information such as node layouts, amount of nodes, and sensors being used are vital.
   2. **Communication methods**
    The user must elaborate on how they want their device to communicate with the outside world, this could be an option of using WiFi, preferring LoRA, and/or more.
   3. **Configure artificial intelligence**
    Dynamic responses are dependent on use-case and those should be noted here. Key data such as longitude, latitude, environment, climate, etc... should be reviewed.
   4. **Extensions and tools**
    As the focus of this project is to provide modular systems, these modules can be maintained by an open community whereby their extensions integrated here.

3. **All set and ready to go!**
    Follows with an brief overview of the configuration, then guides the user to their personalized dashboard.
